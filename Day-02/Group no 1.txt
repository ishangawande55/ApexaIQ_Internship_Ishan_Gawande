Problem
You are given an array A  of length N. A subarray is called special if the XOR and Sum of the subarray are the same. Find the number of special subarrays of A.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T
, which denotes the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N
, which denotes the length of array A.
The second line of each test case contains N
 space-separated integers, denoting elements of array A.
 
Output Format

For each test case, print the number of special subarrays of A.

Constraints
1<= T <= 10
1<= N <= 10^5
1<= Ai <= 10^9
